OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Type
Used to get an access token after a user authorizes an app after login success fully using okta where we had configured user , client id and secret and redirect uri.

1 >user will be rediredect to login page ( okta ) with request containing  -response_type=code ,-redirect url ,- clientid, -scope ,-state to be passed to authorization server

2 > on succesful login request will be redirected to redirect url with state and code in param.
    This code is authorization code genrated by authorization server relatively sort lived
    
3> exchange the authorization code for an authtoken from backchangel in application .By making a POST call to token endpoint.
    contains follwing.
    grant_type= authorization_code
    code=
    redirect-uri=same used in step1
    client id
    client secret=to assure that request is made from application and not from potentisl attacker if then able to get code from response.
    
 4>The token endpoint will verify all the parameters in the request, ensuring the code hasnâ€™t expired 
     and that the client ID and secret match. If everything checks out, it will generate an access token and return it in the response!
